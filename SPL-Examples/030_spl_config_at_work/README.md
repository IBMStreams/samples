This example introduces one of the must-learn features of the SPL language. SPL language offers an extensive list of options to do configuration at the operator level as well as at the composite level. This application attempts to sprinkle many of the available configuration parameters as shown below.

a) host
b) hostColocation
c) partitionColocation
d) placement
e) threadedPort and queue
f) relocatable and many more.

In addition, this example shows how to make this application toolkit dependent on another (025_dynamic_filter_at_work) SPL toolkit project.
