/*
This is example 1 in the series of 12 User Defined Parallelism (UDP) scenarios.
UDP is a great feature to parallelize an entire composite or a particular operator.

This example code is taken from the Streams InfoCenter and added here to benefit the
beginners of the Streams SPL programming model. Many thanks to our Streams colleague
Scott Schneider for coming up with this set of UDP examples. Full credit goes to him.

It is recommended that you run this example in Distributed mode and visualize the
parallel region in the Streams instance graph.
