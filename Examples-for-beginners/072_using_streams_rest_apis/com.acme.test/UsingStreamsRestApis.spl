/*
This example shows how the Streams REST APIs can be used within the context of an SPL application.
For illustrative purposes, we are showing a few basic REST API calls.
Using this as a base, users can simply try more REST API calls (get job health, get PE details etc.)

In order for this program to work, one has to provide values specific to his/her Streams environment.
Please edit the Java native functions in the impl/java/src directory and change the static values
defined at the top of that Java source file.

Basic template of the REST API Java code was taken from the Streams Knowledge Center. Thanks to
our Streams colleagues Janet Weber and Jason Nikolai for getting the REST API code in the Java file
correctly configured to produce the right results.
