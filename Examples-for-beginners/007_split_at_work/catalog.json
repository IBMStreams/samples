{"category": ["1", "6"], "description": "This example shows how a Split operator can be used to split the incoming tuples based on a key. In this example, the split condition (which tuples comes out on which port) is pre configured through a text file. Alternatively, one can compute the index of the output port on the fly inside the Split operator parameter section.", "language": ["SPL"], "tags": ["split", "split stream", "divide stream"], "url": "https://github.com/IBMStreams/samples/tree/main/Examples-for-beginners/007_split_at_work", "name": "SPLit at work"}
