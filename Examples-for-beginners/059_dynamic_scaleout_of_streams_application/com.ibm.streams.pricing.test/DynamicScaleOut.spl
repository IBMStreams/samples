This SPL composite is the test jig that drives the price
calculation engines running in parallel. This composite provides the
feeder (source), collector (sink), aggregation and performance
timing measurement logic. It works in concert with another SPL composite
named "com.ibm.streams.pricing.Pricer". This application is designed in such
a way to be elastic i.e. Application can be started with x number of 
pricer engines and then more pricer engines can be added or 
removed dynamically according to the resource availability as well as the 
demand for more pricer engines going up and down.
 
For this particular example application, Streams Studio is used only for
editing the project files and visualizing the running application using
the Streams instance graph. That is the reason why you will not see a
launch configuration for this project when you import this project into the 
Streams Studio. You need not create a launch configuration. Because,
this application is built, run, and stopped using bash script files.
For complete details about building, running, and stopping this application,
please look inside the file named readme.txt available at the root of the 
"dynamic_scaleout" project directory.
