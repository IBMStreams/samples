That operator is called JavaOp, which is used to call out to other operators implemented in Java using the Java Operator API. In this example, we will have a tiny Java logic that will calculate the current time and add that time string to a tuple attribute and output that tuple. There is another example that shows the Java primitive operator that is different from the JavaOp operator."}
